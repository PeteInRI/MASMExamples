# MASMExamples
Sample code for Beginning MASM Programmers
This Repository is primarily for students taking CYB2010: Computer Architecture with Assembly Language Programming.
Many of these examples are based on code by Kip Irvine. You can see his site here:

The course uses his book, which is a very good introduction to Microsoft x86 Assembly

The code presented here is intended to provide working examples of common processes taught in the course. If you reuse this code, please credit the author.
